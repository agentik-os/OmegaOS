# Changelog

All notable changes to OmegaOS are recorded here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project aims
for [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) once it reaches 1.0. Until then,
`main` is the only supported line.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- GitHub Actions CI: build the workspace with `-D warnings` and run the test
  suite as hard gates; clippy and rustfmt run as advisory steps.
- Hand-written, human-voiced README with French, Russian, and Chinese
  translations, plus a "How a mission runs" section explaining the
  Master → oracle → worker → workflow flow.
- Contributor docs: this changelog, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and issue/PR templates.

### Changed
- Terminal output (TUI and CLI) is now emoji-free, using the `[+]/[~]/[x]`
  ASCII convention. Telegram messages keep their emoji.

### Fixed
- `credentials` test that was flaky under parallel runs (it mutated the global
  `HOME`); the HOME-touching tests are now serialized.
- Dead code removed across the orchestration and TUI crates so the workspace
  builds with zero warnings.
- Oracle respawn no longer trusts a stale registry entry, and the patrol daemon
  re-checks session liveness before auto-marking a worker done.

## [0.1.0]

Initial public cut. The `omega` CLI and TUI, the rmux-backed session model, the
typed doctrine (6 Laws and 20 Rules) injected into every dispatched agent, the
oracle/worker orchestration layer, the Quality Arsenal audits, and the optional
Telegram bridge.
