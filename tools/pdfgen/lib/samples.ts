  abstract:
    "Autonomous agent teams remove the bottleneck of human coordination. By delegating planning, execution and verification to a hierarchy of specialized agents, organizations compress months of work into hours while preserving — and often improving — quality. This paper documents the architecture, the failure modes and the operating principles that make it work.",

      body: `Most engineering organizations spend more time **coordinating work** than doing the work itself. Each new contributor adds n communication links, n review responsibilities, n contexts to maintain. The math is unforgiving: at fifteen people you spend half your day in sync.

Agent teams break this curve because the coordination layer is *automated*. Plans are produced by a planner, executed by workers, audited by reviewers, and shipped without a standup in sight.

> The right unit of leverage is not the engineer — it is the pipeline.

The remainder of this whitepaper documents how to build that pipeline in practice.`

      lead: "A clean separation between intent, decomposition, execution and verification.",
      body: `Every autonomous team needs four distinct surfaces:

- **Intent surface** — where the human states a goal in natural language.
- **Decomposition surface** — where the goal becomes a dependency-aware plan.
- **Execution surface** — where workers carry out tasks in parallel.
- **Verification surface** — where auditors challenge the work before it ships.

Skipping any one of these produces predictable pathologies. Without verification, hallucinations compound. Without decomposition, workers thrash on ambiguous goals. Without an intent surface, the system is a tool, not a teammate.`

      body: `### Premature confidence
Agents confidently produce convincing but wrong outputs. Mitigate by separating the *researcher* and *verifier* roles.

### Context starvation
Workers without enough context guess. Pre-inline the minimum viable brief: scope, constraints, file paths, success criteria.

### Pipeline drift
Each retry edits more files. Mitigate with strict ownership boundaries and per-task scope locks.`

  body: `## The window

Eat between **15:00 and 20:00**. Outside that window: water, black coffee, no exception.

## What goes in

- Animal protein anchor: 180–240g, prioritized over carbs.
- Two fistfuls of vegetables, cooked, with quality fat.
- One serving slow carbs **only if** training day.
- Zero refined sugar. Honey is sugar in disguise.

## What it produces

| Week | Energy | Sleep | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|-------|
| 1    | Low    | Stable | Adaptation. Expect headaches. |
| 2    | Climbing | Deepens | Hunger flattens. |
| 4    | Steady high | 7h refreshing | Body fat trends down. |

> The discipline is not the food. The discipline is the window.

## Why it matters

OMAD removes a decision and frees a morning. Compound that across a year and you have recovered three weeks of focused time.`
