# Evaluation {OS}

<!-- agentik:scaffold -->

> Measure AI output quality with rubrics, not vibes.

**Suite position:** `69` in **08 · AI & SYSTEMS** (Intelligence infrastructure for everything).

## What this OS is for

Evaluation {OS} is one operative system of the AGENTIK {OS} suite. It is not a
prompt and not a document: it is a system with its own operating specification,
workflows, commands, memory rules, evaluations and adapters, installed and run
by the Agentik Runtime.

Use it when your problem is: measure ai output quality with rubrics, not vibes.

## Status

Scaffolded against the AGENTIK {OS} contract. Sections still carrying the
scaffold marker are structure, not authored content.
