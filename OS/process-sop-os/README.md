<!-- agentik:scaffold -->

> Turn a thing you do well into a thing anyone can do.

**Suite position:** `46` in **05 · OPERATE** (Turn chaos into repeatable execution).

## What this OS is for

Process & SOP {OS} is one operative system of the AGENTIK {OS} suite. It is not a
prompt and not a document: it is a system with its own operating specification,
workflows, commands, memory rules, evaluations and adapters, installed and run
by the Agentik Runtime.

Use it when your problem is: turn a thing you do well into a thing anyone can do.

## Status

Scaffolded against the AGENTIK {OS} contract. Sections still carrying the
scaffold marker are structure, not authored content.
