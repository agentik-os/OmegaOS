> Read rooms and people accurately, and act with integrity.

**Suite position:** `10` in **01 · PERSONAL** (Operate yourself).

## What this OS is for

Social Intelligence {OS} is one operative system of the AGENTIK {OS} suite. It is not a
prompt and not a document: it is a system with its own operating specification,
workflows, commands, memory rules, evaluations and adapters, installed and run
by the Agentik Runtime.

Use it when your problem is: read rooms and people accurately, and act with integrity.
