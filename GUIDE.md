# The OmegaOS Guide

> The operator manual — for a human receiving OmegaOS for the first time AND for
> a fresh LLM agent operating it. Everything here is checked against the live
> binary (`omega 0.1.5`); when this document and your runtime disagree, trust
> `omega --help` and `omega doctor`. Setup steps live in
> [docs/GETTING-STARTED.md](docs/GETTING-STARTED.md) (`omega guide`).

## 1. What OmegaOS is

OmegaOS is a control plane for a fleet of Claude Code agents on one box. It
turns a Linux machine (typically a VPS) into a place where you dispatch work in
one sentence and a hierarchy of agents — a Master that routes, an oracle per
project that plans, ephemeral workers that edit — executes it in parallel under
a single typed rulebook, verifies it adversarially, and reports back to your
terminal or your phone. You drive it from three cockpits: a TUI, the `omega`
CLI, and a Telegram hub.

## 2. The vocabulary (read this first)

Every term below is load-bearing. Missions fail when these get conflated.

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Session** | An rmux PTY with a role: **Master** (the routing brain), **Oracle** (per-project orchestrator), **Worker** (ephemeral editor), **Home** (your own interactive shells, e.g. `claude-1`), **System** (daemons like the Telegram bridge). `omega list` shows them. |
| **Mission** | A request dispatched to an oracle (`omega dispatch <Project> "<mission>"` or a message in the project's Telegram topic). Tracked from dispatch to `done.json`. |
| **Oracle** | One per project. It classifies, plans, dispatches workers, runs the quality gate, and reports. It **never edits project code itself** — the grader and the writer are different agents. |
| **Worker** | Ephemeral, parallel, file-scope-locked editor. Named `<Project>-worker-<task>`. It does ONE task, verifies against runtime, and signals completion with `omega done`. |
| **Workflow** | In-process fan-out *inside* one agent: spawn parallel sub-agents, adversarially verify their outputs, synthesize one answer. Cheaper than dispatching a worker per subtask; the default for review/research/audit/design work. |
| **Goal** | ONE shell-verifiable condition looped until true (the `/omg-goal` skill inside a Claude session). A thermostat, not a campaign — never wrap a multi-step mission in one goal. |
| **Plan** | A typed DAG of single-worker steps in `.planner/tracker.json`, written by `/omg-planner` and executed by `omega plan-run` with **Gate** (structural can't-skip) + **Guardian** (independent verify command) enforcement. |
| **Atlas** | The orchestrator brain on Telegram — the discussion topic where you talk to the Master. Atlas classifies and routes; it does not do the work inline. |
| **Skill** | A shipped `/omg-*` protocol (e.g. `/omg-planner`, `/omg-llm-council`). Installed under `~/.omega/skills/`; invoked by name inside a Claude session. |
| **Audit** | A forensic quality skill from the 23-audit Quality Arsenal (`omega audit list`). Gestalt clarity gate + Popper falsification + 10x scrutiny on the hinge point. |
| **done.json** | The only completion signal. A worker writes `~/.omega/state/worker-<session>.done.json` via `omega done`; without `status: done_clean` the work is not done, whatever the agent says. |

## 3. The doctrine in 1 page

Six Laws bind every agent, at every level, always. From the registry
(`omega rules list` — source: `crates/omega-core/src/rules.rs`):

- **L0 — Ship the truth, reproducible & pushed.** A change isn't done until it
  survives a clean rebuild and is pushed. For OmegaOS itself: a fresh
  `git clone && ./install.sh` must reproduce it. Secrets live outside the repo,
  always.
- **L1 — Runtime is the only truth.** Code and comments state intent; only
  running the program reveals reality. When code and runtime disagree, runtime
  wins.
- **L2 — Researcher, not sycophant.** Challenge a flawed premise with reasoning
  before acting — never agree-and-code. "This should work" without evidence is
  a lie.
- **L3 — Decide and proceed.** A dispatched agent is autonomous: it never asks
  "should I continue?". Detect the flaw, state the corrected premise, pick the
  best path, execute, report after.
- **L4 — Done means 100%, verified.** Enumerate every task in the prompt,
  finish each, self-verify each against runtime. 92% is not done.
- **L5 — Quality over speed.** Tokens are unlimited; quality is the only
  constraint. Never a "streamlined/quick" variant of a real protocol. A
  403/401/blocked surface is an ABORT, never a PASS.

The operational Rules (26 at the time of writing) implement the Laws, one
category at a time. One example each:

| Category | Example rule |
|---|---|
| Universal | **R-KARPATHY** — think before coding, simplicity first, surgical changes, goal-driven execution. |
| QualityGate | **R-VERIFY** — a delegate's own "done" is an input, never the verdict; verify adversarially, ≥2-of-3 consensus. |
| Orchestration | **R-ORCH** — workflow-first: fan out file-disjoint work in parallel, verify adversarially, synthesize yourself. |
| Reporting | **R-CITE** — evidence or it didn't happen: every claim carries a file:line, log line, or screenshot. |
| Safety | **R-SCOPE** — one writer per file: declare each worker's file scope; overlap → serialize or worktree-isolate. |

Each Rule is scoped to the roles it binds (Master / Oracle / Worker), and the
funnel — `rules::agent_context_block(scope)` — injects the role-scoped slice
into every agent's prompt at dispatch. Nobody can spawn a child that quietly
drops a Law.

## 4. Driving it — the three cockpits

### 4a. The TUI (`omega`)

Five tabs (cycle with arrow keys; `Tab` toggles focus between panels):

| Tab | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Sessions** | Live session list with roles and progress; the right panel mirrors the selected pane and accepts chat input. Kill, lock, rename, attach. |
| **Menu** | Launch actions: new Claude/Codex/Gemini/Pi/Hermes/GLM/terminal session, **[N] New Project**, dispatch to an oracle, refresh, protection toggle, kill / kill-all / nuclear cleanup, restart, quit. |
| **Agentic** | The agentic state: projects (with per-project actions and a 3-tier delete), doctrine info, oracle/worker tree. |
| **Settings** | Theme gallery (live preview — see [docs/THEMES.md](docs/THEMES.md)), provider/model config, API keys, agent installs, the Monitor group (billing, accounts, bot status, provisioning keys wizard). |
| **Help** | Keybindings and usage hints. |

**Scrolling & mouse — know your transport.** Over **plain SSH** the mouse works
end-to-end: wheel scrolls the session mirror (and the pane scrollback in a
direct `rmux attach`), click focuses, and drag-selecting text in the mirror
copies it to your local clipboard via OSC 52. Over **mosh** the mouse is dead
by design — mosh does not replicate the mouse-mode handshake to your terminal
([mosh#101](https://github.com/mobile-shell/mosh/issues/101)) — so keep a plain
SSH profile for mouse-heavy work and use the keyboard over mosh: `PgUp`/`PgDn`
(full-page mirror scroll, chat focus included), `Home`/`End` (top/tail),
`Alt+↑/↓` (line scroll — also works attached directly to a session). Claude
sessions scroll deep because OmegaOS runs them on the normal screen
(`CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ALTERNATE_SCREEN=1`) with a 500k-line rmux history.

### 4b. The CLI — the ~15 you'll use daily

```bash
omega doctor                                  # whole-stack health; --fix repairs mechanical issues
omega                                         # the TUI (alias: omega menu)
omega rules list                              # the Laws + Rules, role-scoped registry
omega dispatch MyApp "fix the signup flow"    # send a mission to MyApp's oracle
omega spawn-worker fix-auth "..." --files src/auth.rs --worktree   # worker, scope-locked + isolated
omega done <session> done_clean "what+proof"  # worker completion signal (done_clean|pending|failed|blocked)
omega progress <session> --plan "audit|fix N+1|merge"              # oracle progress → Telegram card
omega status <session>                        # session status + pane content
omega plan-run [dir]                          # execute .planner/tracker.json (Gate + Guardian)
omega patrol                                  # session-health watchdog (also runs from cron)
omega cleanup                                 # prune stray sessions, stale state, /tmp scratch
omega kill-all                                # kill everything except you + infrastructure
omega sync                                    # symlink OmegaOS config into every LLM config dir
OMEGA_TG_TOKEN=<TOKEN> omega telegram setup <ID> --user-id <ID>    # wire the Telegram bot
omega guide                                   # re-print the getting-started steps
```

(A goal loop is a Claude-session primitive, not a CLI command: type `/omg-goal

### 4c. The Telegram hub

One command bot (systemd service `omega-tg-bot`) plus a topics group:

- **Atlas topic** — discussion with the orchestrator brain. Ask questions,
  give direction; Atlas classifies and dispatches. Reports do not land here.
- **Project topics** — one per project (`/setupgroup` then `/sync`). Message a
  topic = dispatch a mission to that project's oracle. While it runs you get a
  **live progress card** (task checklist + bar, edited in place), and at the
  end a **mission PDF report** with a "steps to verify" section.
- **Alerts topic** — operational alerts only (stuck oracle, token budget,
  catastrophic failures). Auto-recreated if deleted.
- **Deposit / inbox bot** — a private second bot (`inbox-bot-up <TOKEN>`):
  anything you send from your phone (photos, files, notes) lands in
  `~/.omega/inbox/`, timestamped and indexed, where any agent can read it.
- **Per-project agent bots** — optionally give a project its own bot: register
  the token via the command bot's project menu; it's stored in
  `~/.omega/agent-bots.json` and runs as `omega-tg-agent-<project>.service`.
- **Companion bots** — an instant lightweight co-worker (Haiku) on its own bot
  for chat-speed assistance, separate from the heavy mission pipeline.

The command bot's slash surface: `/menu /account /model /projects /sessions
/audits /skills /status /dispatch /login /setupgroup /sync` — plain text goes
to the Atlas brain.

## 5. Your first 3 missions (copy-paste)

**1. A dispatch.** Drop any repo under `~/Station/<Category>/<Name>` (it's
auto-discovered), then:

```bash
omega dispatch MyApp "Add input validation to the signup form: email format, password >= 12 chars, inline errors. Verify with the existing test suite."
omega timeline oracle-MyApp     # watch what the oracle did, step by step
```

The oracle plans, spawns workers, gates the result, and (with Telegram wired)
posts the progress card + final PDF in the project's topic.

**2. A new project, end to end.**

```bash
omega new-project acme --dry-run    # print the plan first
omega new-project acme              # provision -> scaffold -> vision -> PRD -> plan -> build
```

Or in any Claude session: `/omg-new-project`. With service keys in
`~/.omega/provisioning/services.env` it auto-provisions Vercel / Convex /
GitHub / Clerk / Stripe; without them it pauses honestly and tells you what it
needs. The build phase is a typed plan executed by `omega plan-run`.

**3. An audit.**

```bash
omega audit list                  # the 23-audit arsenal
omega audit run codeaudit --dir . # prints the exact spawn-worker command to run it
omega audit select "fix auth"     # which audits a mission would auto-trigger
```

Or inside a Claude session, invoke the skill directly: `/omg-codeaudit`,
`/omg-secaudit`, `/omg-uiuxaudit`, …

## 6. The skill catalog

Shipped in `skills/` (repo) → `~/.omega/skills/` (installed); invoked as
`/omg-<name>` in any Claude session. Grouped:

| Group | Skill | One line |
|---|---|---|
| Pipeline | `vision` | Product identity + emotional positioning via Socratic discovery → VISION.md. |
| | `prd` | Full product-docs suite (requirements, stories, stack, milestones) for agent implementation. |
| | `brand-identity` | Complete brand system → deployed interactive brand book (opt-in step). |
| | `planner` | Decompose work into a typed DAG → `.planner/tracker.json` for `omega plan-run`. |
| | `new-project` | The end-to-end bootstrap: provision → scaffold → vision → PRD → plan → build. |
| Quality | `audits/` (23) | The forensic arsenal: code, sec, perf, a11y, uiux, flow, api, copy, data, debug, dep, dx, feature, i18n, logic, motion, observability, privacy, refont, release, retention, seo, automation. |
| | `acceptance` | Autonomous browser-acceptance + self-heal gate: sweep every route, fix, re-run until green. |
| Decision | `llm-council` | Four Claude models answer independently, peer-review anonymously, a president synthesizes with dissent. No API keys. |
| Marketing | `market-research` | Market size, trends, competitors, decision-makers (gooseworks API). |
| | `marketing-strategist` | GTM/product-marketing/demand-gen strategy lens. |
| | `product-marketing-context` | The positioning/ICP/messaging doc every other marketing skill reads — run first. |
| | `content-strategy` | Topic clusters, pillars, editorial calendar. |
| | `social-content` | Organic posts, threads, carousels, short-form scripts. |
| | `cold-email` | B2B outbound emails + follow-up sequences. |
| | `ad-creative` | Paid-ad copy at scale, iterated on performance data. |
| | `launch-strategy` | Launch/GTM plan: Product Hunt, waitlist, channels. |
| Browser | `browser-use` | Agentic cloud browser for tasks scripted Playwright can't express. |
| Ops | `cleanup` | Disk/session/cache hygiene for the VPS and projects. |
| | `project-tidy` | De-sprawl a repo polluted by agent output (docs/ + agentic/ convention). |
| | `ramflush` | Kernel cache purge + before/after perf report. |
| | `linear` / `linear-setup` | Resolve Linear feedback tickets end to end / one-time widget+labels wizard. |
| Media | `pdfgen` | The branded PDF engine behind `omega pdf` (whitepaper/audit/marketing/doc). |
| | `higgsfield-soul-id` / `higgsfield-generate` | Train a face-faithful Soul character / generate brand-quality images, video, ads. |
| Design | `design` | Tier-1 design-taste engine (inspiration canon) used by the UI pipeline. |

Your installed `~/.omega/skills/` may hold more (user-added libraries); `ls
~/.omega/skills` is the live list, and the Telegram bot's `/skills` shows it
too.

## 7. How work is verified

Nothing in OmegaOS is "done because the agent said so":

1. **done.json** — a worker must write a typed completion signal; the gate
   checks every cited artifact (commit SHA on the remote, file paths, command
   exit codes, URL probes) against reality before `done_clean` is accepted.
2. **Gate (structural)** — in `omega plan-run`, a step cannot be skipped: the
   engine only advances the DAG when the step's `done.json` lands and its
   invariants hold. Skip-prone plans are rejected before the run starts.
3. **Guardian (independent)** — every plan step carries a real
   `verify_command`; the engine runs it itself. A worker's self-report alone
   never completes a step (trivial verify commands like `true` are refused).
4. **Adversarial 2-of-3 consensus** — claims go to independent grader lenses
   (rubric, Popper falsification, regression); a claim survives only if a
   majority agree. The grader is never the writer (R-VERIFY).
5. **Audits at the gate** — the oracle auto-selects the Quality Arsenal audits
   that fit what changed (`omega audit select`).
6. **The mission PDF** — the final report, with a linked "steps to verify"
   section, lands in the project's Telegram topic so the human can re-check
   the proof, not just read the summary.

## 8. Day-2 operations

- `omega doctor` — first command when anything feels off; names the broken
  piece. `omega doctor --fix` repairs the mechanical ones (a self-heal cron
  also runs it every 3 h).
- `omega patrol` — the watchdog (cron, every minute): restarts the rmux
  daemon, resurrects crashed oracles, reaps stale workers.
- `omega resurrect` — bring dead oracles back from persisted state after a
  crash or daemon restart.
- `omega timeline <oracle>` — replay a mission dispatch-by-dispatch when
  something looks stuck.
- `omega usage` — token-budget status; Telegram alerts fire at 80/90%.
- `omega backup` — one `.tgz` of the irreproducible state (`~/.omega` +
  crontab) to `scp` off the box before a reset. Restore procedure:
  [docs/RESET-RECOVERY.md](docs/RESET-RECOVERY.md).
- `omega cleanup` / `omega kill-all` / `omega clean-junk` — session and state
  hygiene, safest first.
- **Logs** live in `~/.omega/logs/` (session logs, bot logs); runtime state in
  `~/.omega/state/`; audit results in `~/.omega/audit/`.

## 9. For LLM agents operating OmegaOS

If you are an agent reading this on an OmegaOS box, this is your contract:

- **What's injected into you.** `~/.omega/OMEGA.md` (universal instructions —
  synced into every LLM CLI's config by `omega sync`) and your role-scoped
  slice of the Laws + Rules via `rules::agent_context_block(scope)`. The full
  registry: `omega rules list`; editable copies in `~/.omega/rules/`.
- **Where state lives.** `~/.omega/state/` — session metadata, scope locks,
  done signals, progress files. Project plans live in the project's
  `.planner/tracker.json`.
- **How to signal done.** Run
  `omega done <session> <status> "<summary>" [--commit <sha>]` with status
  `done_clean | pending | failed | blocked`. This writes
  `~/.omega/state/worker-<session>.done.json`. The schema
  (`crates/omega-core/src/done.rs::DoneSignal`) carries: `session`, `status`,
  `summary`, optional `commit`, `finished_at`, `todos_total` /
  `todos_completed`, `pending_actions[]`, and the ground-truth fields —
  `not_done[]` (REQUIRED honesty: what is not done, even on success),
  `scope.confirms[]` / `scope.does_not_confirm[]`, `corroboration[]`
  (independent signals: `git_remote`, `ci_exit_code`, `prod_healthcheck`,
  `filesystem_check`, `independent_auditor`, … — `worker_self_report` alone is
  never sufficient), `failure_mode` (fabrication / instruction_following /
  cheap_verification_skipped / ignored_correction), `retry_thrash_count`, and
  `artifacts[]` (citations the gate verifies: `git_sha`, `git_branch`,
  `file_path`, `command` + exit code, `url` + expected status, `note`).
- **How to report progress.** Oracles:
  `omega progress <session> --plan "task1|task2|task3"` to set the plan, then
  `omega progress <session> --task "task1" --status done|fail|doing|todo` per
  task. Writes `~/.omega/state/oracle-<key>.progress.json`; the Telegram bot
  renders it as the live card.
- **How to signal blocked.** `omega done <session> blocked "<what blocks you +
  the fallback you already started>"`. Never idle waiting for a human (L3);
  finish every file-disjoint safe task first (L4).
- **The scope-claim protocol.** Before you (or a worker you spawn) write a
  file, the file set must be claimed: `omega spawn-worker <task> "<prompt>"
  --files a.rs,b.rs` claims them with real advisory locks; `omega scope`
  checks for conflicts. Overlapping scope → serialize, or isolate with
  `--worktree` and merge back with `omega-git-merge`. Never two writers on one
  file (R-SCOPE).

## 10. Sharing it / installing on a new box

```bash
npx omega-os          # guided install (Matrix screen, Telegram wizard)
# or
git clone https://github.com/agentik-os/OmegaOS && cd OmegaOS && ./install.sh
```

**What a fresh install reproduces** (Law 0 — install parity): the `rmux` +
`omega` binaries (prebuilt when a release exists, else built from source), the
doctrine, the agents, all shipped skills, the Telegram bot services, the
self-healing crons, shell integration, and the hardened terminal config.

**What is local secret state** — recreated per machine, never in any repo:
`~/.omega/credentials/` (OAuth tokens, API keys), `telegram.toml`,
`deposit.toml`, `agent-bots.json` (per-project bot tokens),
`provisioning/services.env`, and companion-bot secrets (e.g.
`nova-secrets.env`). `omega backup` is how they survive a box reset.

**Opt-in extras** at install time: `OMEGA_WITH_BROWSER=1 ./install.sh` adds
the Playwright/browser stack (skippable later via the printed one-liner);
`OMEGA_WITH_NOVA=1` for the companion-bot stack is rolling out alongside it.
After any install or update: `omega doctor` — every line `[+]`.
