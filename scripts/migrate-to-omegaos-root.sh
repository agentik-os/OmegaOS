# migrate-to-omegaos-root.sh — consolidate OmegaOS into one clean root:
#
#   ~/OmegaOS/
#     ├── VibeCoding/   your projects        (symlink → existing projects dir)
#     ├── Setup/        the OmegaOS git repo (symlink → this clone)
#     └── System/       all state + secrets  (the real ~/.omega, moved here)
#
# WHY symlinks, not a hard move: ~/.omega is in active use by the patrol cron,
# the systemd Telegram bridge, and any running agents holding file-locks. Moving
# the real directory and leaving a symlink behind means every existing
# ~/.omega caller keeps resolving, with zero code change and zero downtime. The
# binary's config::omega_dir() also prefers ~/OmegaOS/System when it exists, so
# new processes use the new path directly.
#
# This is OPT-IN and IDEMPOTENT. Re-running after a successful migration is a
# no-op. It is reversible (see the printed instructions at the end).
#
# What it does NOT touch (these belong to other tools, not OmegaOS):
#   ~/.claude ~/.codex ~/.config ~/.cargo ~/.rmux.conf ~/.zshrc systemd units
#   ~/.local/bin (the omega/rmux binaries stay on the standard XDG PATH).
