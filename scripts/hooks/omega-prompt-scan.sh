#!/usr/bin/env bash
# omega-prompt-scan.sh — UserPromptSubmit hook: catch, at the moment the prompt
# arrives, the two shapes that are unrecoverable later.
#
#   BRANCH 1 — MULTI-ASK: several asks in one prompt, whose tail tasks get
#              silently dropped (L6 ENUMERATE, R-PLAN, R-ORCH fan-out).
#   BRANCH 2 — HIGH BLAST RADIUS: an ask to IMPLEMENT something touching auth,
#              money, migrations/schema, deletion, or a whole new surface —
#              where guessing costs a rewrite (R-PREFLIGHT).
#
# The two branches are INDEPENDENT: either can fire alone, both can fire together,
# and when both fire the injected note covers both without repeating itself.
#
# WHY HERE AND NOT AT STOP TIME: refusing a stop because "you should have fanned
# out" (or "you should have asked first") is useless — the work is already done,
# the turn is already spent. The only moment those decisions can still be made is
# when the prompt lands. So this hook never blocks; it injects context exactly
# when it can still change what happens.
#
# Deliberately quiet: it only speaks when the prompt genuinely looks like several
# asks, or genuinely looks like a high-stakes implementation. An ordinary prompt
# gets nothing, because a nudge that fires every turn is a nudge that gets
# ignored. Proportionality is enforced on branch 2 too: an obviously-tiny ask
# (typo, rename, one-liner) is skipped outright.
#
# Output: {"hookSpecificOutput":{"hookEventName":"UserPromptSubmit",
#          "additionalContext":"…"}} — or nothing at all.
