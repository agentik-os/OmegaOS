# stop-verify-hook.sh — THE FINISH GUARD (Stop hook).

# Enforces L6 (finish the mission, never stop mid-workflow), R-PLAN (a tracked
# plan or it gets dropped) and L1/L4 (run something before calling it done).
#
# WHY IT BLOCKS INSTEAD OF REMINDING: the original version only `echo`ed a
# reminder and exited 0. A Stop hook that exits 0 is INVISIBLE to the model — its
# stdout goes to the transcript, never into the conversation — so that reminder
# had never once reached an agent. Only exit code 2 (stderr → model, stop
# refused) changes behaviour. Filename kept so every already-installed
# ~/.claude/settings.json inherits the fix with no migration.
#
# Transcript parsing lives in omega_plan_state.py, shared with the SessionStart
# contract hook so the two never drift apart.
#
# CONTRACT
#   stdin  : {"session_id":…, "transcript_path":…, "stop_hook_active":bool}
#   exit 0 : stop allowed (also the fail-open path — a guard must never break a session)
#   exit 2 : stop REFUSED, stderr is handed to the model as its next instruction
#
# LOOP SAFETY (R-LOOP): never blocks when the harness reports stop_hook_active,
# and never more than MAX_BLOCKS times per session — past the ceiling it stops
# nagging and hands control back to the operator.
