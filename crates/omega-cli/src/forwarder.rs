//! Ordered keystroke forwarder.
//!
//! The TUI chat-focus path forwards one keystroke per event to a target rmux
//! session. A previous optimization fired each forward on its own
//! `tokio::spawn`, which — on the multi-threaded `#[tokio::main]` runtime —
//! let N independent tasks race to the SDK transport's single FIFO actor on
//! different worker threads. Fast typing / drain batches could therefore be
//! delivered OUT OF ORDER (e.g. "abc" landing as "acb").
//!
//! This module replaces those racing spawns with ONE consumer task draining a
//! single FIFO mpsc channel. Because exactly one task reaches the transport,
//! ordering is guaranteed. Adjacent `Text` messages for the same session are
//! coalesced into a single send for efficiency; a `Key` or a session switch
//! flushes pending text first, preserving exact interleaving order.
