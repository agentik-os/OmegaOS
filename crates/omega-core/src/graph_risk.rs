//! Graph risk gate: the human-in-the-loop check that sits IN FRONT of execution
//! and decides whether a ready node may run with nobody watching (R-DESTRUCT).
//!
//! [`crate::graph_executor`] answers "what may run now". It answers that
//! structurally, from edges and retry budgets, and it has no opinion on what a
//! node DOES. That is the gap this module fills: a node whose incoming edges are
//! all satisfied is runnable, and a node that drops a production schema is also
//! runnable by exactly the same test. Wiring the executor straight to a
//! dispatcher therefore runs the irreversible step the moment its dependencies
//! land, unattended, with no record that anyone ever chose it.
//!
//! R-DESTRUCT says what to do instead, and it says it in two halves that this
//! file keeps together. An interactive session asks a human and waits. A
//! DISPATCHED session cannot wait, because nobody is watching the prompt: it
//! performs every non-destructive part of the mission, writes a durable record
//! naming the destructive step, what would be lost, and the safer alternative,
//! signals blocked, and escalates through the alert funnel. The ask still
//! happens, asynchronously, through an artifact a human can act on later,
//! instead of against a prompt nobody will answer. [`ExecutionMode`] is that
//! distinction made into a type, and [`EscalationRecord`] is that artifact.
//!
//! WHAT THIS IS NOT, and the boundary is the point: no process spawn, no
//! network, no filesystem write, no CLI. [`evaluate_gate`] is a pure function of
//! its four arguments, so the same graph plus the same state reaches the same
//! decision on every machine and a run is auditable by replay alone. Persisting
//! the record, printing it, sending the alert and asking the operator are the
//! caller's job, and a decision core that did any of them could not be tested
//! without a box to run on.
//!
//! Three invariants shape every type here:
//!
//! 1. NO DESTRUCTIVE MIGRATION, EVER. The classification is written into the
//!    forward-compatible `extra` bag of [`Node`], exactly as
//!    [`crate::graph_executor::FALLBACK_KEY`] writes a fallback, so a `Graph`
//!    document authored before risk existed still deserializes untouched and
//!    round-trips through this version with nothing dropped or renamed. Nothing
//!    in this file adds a field to `graph.rs`, and nothing rewrites a key it
//!    does not own.
//! 2. AN UNCLASSIFIED NODE IS NOT A SAFE NODE. The default is
//!    [`RiskLevel::Elevated`], never `Safe`. The reasoning is in the `Default`
//!    impl, and it is the single most consequential choice in this file.
//! 3. AN APPROVAL REQUEST THAT DOES NOT SAY WHAT IS LOST IS NOT INFORMED
//!    CONSENT. [`GateDecision::RequireApproval`] always carries a non-empty
//!    `what_is_lost`, synthesized honestly when the node declared none, because
//!    a human asked to approve "step 7" with no statement of the damage is being
//!    asked to rubber-stamp, not to decide.
