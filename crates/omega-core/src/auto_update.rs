//! Daily update check + automatic apply — the decision layer.
//!
//! `omega update --auto` runs from cron on every install. This module owns the
//! part worth testing: given the state of the checkout, the machine and the
//! previous runs, WHAT should happen? The CLI does the git and install.sh work.
//!
//! Auto-applying code fetched from a remote is a real trust decision, so the
//! decision is deliberately conservative and every refusal is named:
//!
//! * nothing to pull → do nothing, cheaply and silently (the common case)
//! * local edits or unpushed commits → never touch them, ever
//! * an agent is mid-turn → defer to tomorrow rather than rebuild under it
//! * the same commit failed [`FAILURE_CAP`] times → stop, escalate to a human
//!   (R-LOOP: retrying a 4th time is thrash, not progress)
//!
//! The failure counter is keyed by TARGET COMMIT, not by a bare tally: a new
//! commit on the remote is a genuinely new attempt and starts from zero, while
//! one bad commit can never be retried forever.

    // that AUTHORS commits — the box OmegaOS is developed on, or anyone who
