//! The AgentikOS operative-systems suite — registry + status for the OS tab
//! (TUI). 25 operative systems along the value chain, in four groups: PERSONAL
//! (Mindset, Health & Energy, Habit Tracker, Alignment, Seductive — the BE /
//! ENERGY layer), the BUILD CHAIN (01 Strategy & Portfolio → 02 Brainstorm →
//! 03 Market Research → 04 Blueprint → 05 Design → 06 Stepper → 07 Builder →
//! 08 Quality/Evaluation/Release), GROWTH (Storyteller, Revenue, Delivery &
//! Customer Success, Relationship & Network, Wealth & Capital — the
//! COMMUNICATE → SELL → DELIVER → CAPITAL layer), and SYSTEMS (Execution,
//! Operations & Automation, Review & Governance, Context & Memory, AI Logic,
//! Content, Books — the AUTOMATE / LEARN / meta layer). Each lives under
//! `OS/<slug>/` in the repo (installed to `~/.omega/os/`); payloads arrive as
//! zips via the Deposit box and are unpacked in place. This module answers,
//! cheaply and with NO network: which OSes exist, where they live on THIS
//! machine, and which concrete readiness surfaces are present. Static presence
//! is never reported as runtime verification.
