//! Adversarial verification tests written by an independent reviewer (not
//! the implementer) for the `GET /v1/agents/{name}/install/stream` WS route
//! in `crates/omega-gateway/src/routes_agents.rs`.
//!
//! SAFETY: exactly like `agents_install_test.rs`, every test here sets
//! `OMEGA_BIN` to a fake, purely-local bash script BEFORE making any
//! request that could reach `install_stream`. No test in this file ever
//! touches the real `~/.local/bin/omega`, `curl`, or `npm`, and no test
//! reaches the network.
//!
//! Two things are verified here that the existing suite does not cover:
//!
//! 1. `dual_stream_large_volume_...`: a few thousand lines on BOTH stdout
//!    and stderr, concurrently, prove the two `forward_lines` tasks feeding
//!    one mpsc channel don't deadlock or drop lines under volume.
//!
//! 2. `mid_stream_client_disconnect_...`: a client that disconnects while
//!    the fake installer is still producing output. This is the important
//!    one — it does NOT merely check "the test process doesn't hang" (that
//!    alone would pass even if the bug below existed, because
//!    `forward_lines` returning on a failed `tx.send` after `drop(rx)`
//!    eventually unblocks *this* test regardless). It checks whether the
//!    REAL child process tree is actually terminated on disconnect, by
//!    giving the fake "installer" a NESTED child process (mirroring
//!    `omega-cli`'s real `cmd_install`, which runs `bash -c
//!    <install_command>` via `.status()` — a genuine child of the `omega`
//!    process, not the process the gateway itself spawned) that would write
//!    a marker file well after the point where the gateway kills on
//!    disconnect. `install_stream_loop` now spawns `omega` into its own
//!    process group (`process_group(0)`) and, on disconnect, kills the
//!    WHOLE group (`kill -- -<pid>`, see `kill_process_group` in
//!    `routes_agents.rs`) instead of the single direct PID — which reaches
//!    the nested `bash -c` too, since it inherits the group. If the marker
//!    file is written anyway, the group-kill failed to actually stop the
//!    real work — the socket closed but the install kept running
//!    unsupervised.
