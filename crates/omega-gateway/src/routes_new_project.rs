//! `GET /v1/new-project/stream?name=&category=&group=` — runs `omega
//! new-project` and streams its stdout/stderr.
//!
//! DEVIATION FROM THE LITERAL TASK BRIEF, already recorded in
//! `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`'s Task B ground-truth section:
//! `cmd_new_project` (`crates/omega-cli/src/main.rs:3191`) is FAST, NOT
//! long-running — a non-dry-run invocation does exactly ONE thing beyond
//! printing: `mgr.create_session_with_agent(...).await?`, which spawns a
//! Codex rmux session running the `/omega-new-project ...` prompt and
//! returns in well under a second, identical in shape to
//! `cmd_new`/`cmd_dispatch`. The WHOLE vision -> PRD -> brand -> planner ->
//! build pipeline then runs ASYNCHRONOUSLY *inside* that spawned session —
//! invisible to this CLI process, and out of scope for this wave to watch
//! (that would mean streaming an arbitrary rmux pane, R-STREAM's job, not
//! this endpoint's). Built anyway, exactly as the brief asked: it's still
//! the correct, useful shape (mirrors `routes_agents::install_stream`'s
//! pre-upgrade-validation + Line/Exit-frame pattern 1:1, surfaces a real
//! spawn failure over the socket, and an `Exit` frame confirms the session
//! was created) even though in practice it will emit ~3 short lines then
//! `Exit` almost immediately — the same "browsers can't upgrade a POST"
//! reasoning wave7 already used to collapse `POST /v1/orchestrate` into a
//! GET WS stream, so no separate synchronous `POST /v1/new-project` ships
//! alongside it (one endpoint, not two, avoiding a redundant second code
//! path for the same subprocess).
//!
//! `name` is validated against the CLI's own documented charset
//! (`^[a-z0-9-]+$`, non-empty, capped at 64 bytes — confirmed live via
//! `omega new-project --help`: "Project name (lowercase [a-z0-9-])").
//! `category` is validated against the literal closed set the same `--help`
//! output documents (`Category: works | client | 1-life | AgentikOS`); when
//! omitted, it resolves to the CLI's own documented default (`works`,
//! `#[arg(default_value = "works")]` on `Commands::NewProject::category`).
//! `group` is optional and forwarded as `--group <value>` only when given
//! (`--group <GROUP>` is a real flag, confirmed live: "Provisioning
//! credential group (client projects) [default: default]") — it has no
//! separately documented charset, so this endpoint reuses `name`'s slug
//! check as the safe conservative default, since it flows straight into
//! `--group` and downstream provisioning credential lookup.
//!
//! `stack` (the 2nd positional) is NEVER exposed as a caller-controlled
//! parameter — always hardcoded to the literal `"nextstack"` ("the only
//! stack today" per the CLI's own help text). `--build`, `--resume`,
//! `--from`, `--skip`, `--budget`, and `--dry-run` are NEVER passed — this
//! endpoint only does the plain default bootstrap, none of the CLI's other
//! opt-in modes.
//!
//! CONCURRENCY: capped via `AppState::new_project_permits` — see
//! `server.rs`'s `MAX_CONCURRENT_NEW_PROJECT_SPAWNS` doc comment for why
//! this is sized the same as `orchestrate_permits` despite the subprocess
//! itself being fast: what it spawns is not.
//!
//! NEVER RUN FOR REAL IN TESTS (R-SEC / this task's explicit brief): every
//! test in `tests/new_project_test.rs` points `OMEGA_BIN` at a fake script.
//! Nothing in this crate's test suite or live-verify ever invokes a real
//! `omega new-project`, which spawns an actual Codex session running a real
//! pipeline prompt.
