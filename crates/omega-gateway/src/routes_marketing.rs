//! `GET /v1/marketing` — the marketing-enabled project list, from
//! `omega_core::marketing::list_marketing_projects()`. The filesystem-scan
//! half of that function IS pure/synchronous/side-effect-free (a project is
//! "marketing-enabled" when it has a `<path>/marketing/` directory), but the
//! function as a whole is NOT side-effect-free: it also calls
//! `read_crontab()` (`crates/omega-core/src/marketing.rs`), which spawns a
//! REAL `crontab -l` SUBPROCESS on every single call, with NO timeout —
//! unlike `project_accounts()` in the same file, which is deliberately
//! bounded to a 4s timeout for its own subprocess call. A prior version of
//! this doc comment claimed "no daemon, no network" / "no CLI subprocess",
//! which was false (an independent adversarial review reproduced it live: a
//! fake `crontab` binary placed earlier on `PATH` was invoked by a single
//! `GET /v1/marketing` and influenced the response's `engine_on` field). A
//! hung or adversarially slow `crontab` on `PATH` can pin the
//! `spawn_blocking` thread this handler runs on indefinitely — this crate's
//! shared blocking-thread pool is used by other endpoints too
//! (`routes_sessions`, `routes_projects`, `routes_skills`), so an unbounded
//! subprocess here is a real, if narrow, resource-starvation risk.
//!
//! This endpoint does NOT fix the underlying unbounded subprocess in
//! `omega-core::marketing::read_crontab()` — that function is shared with
//! the TUI and other CLI callers, and changing its behavior/signature is out
//! of scope for a gateway-only fix. Instead, the ENTIRE `spawn_blocking`
//! call is wrapped in [`marketing_list_timeout`] via `tokio::time::timeout`
//! (mirroring `routes_pdf.rs`'s `run_omega_pdf` idiom for its own
//! subprocess-timeout bound): on timeout this handler returns `504 Gateway
//! Timeout` rather than hanging the HTTP request forever. The `crontab -l`
//! subprocess itself is NOT killed by this timeout (`std::process::Command`
//! here is the crate's synchronous blocking call, not a killable
//! `tokio::process::Command` — there is no cheap way to cancel it from
//! outside `spawn_blocking`), so a hung `crontab` still leaks one blocking
//! thread from the pool even after this endpoint has already answered; this
//! bounds the CALLER's wait, not the child process's lifetime.
//!
//! Read-only, list-only: `accounts` (connected social-account count) is
//! NEVER populated by this endpoint. Populating it needs
//! `omega_core::marketing::project_accounts`, which shells out to
//! `omega-zernio` per project and is bounded by its own 4s timeout — fine
//! for an on-demand detail lookup, wrong for a list endpoint that would
//! then shell out once per discovered project on every call. So `accounts`
//! (and `accounts_tried`) always mirror the list-only values the source
//! function itself never populates (`None` / `false`).
//!
//! `slug` is derived from the on-disk directory basename, while dedup in
//! `list_marketing_projects()` keys on the (possibly different) registry
//! `name` — so a registry entry whose display `name` differs from its
//! directory name can survive dedup and appear as two source entries
//! sharing one `slug`. This handler dedupes the RESPONSE by canonicalized
//! `path` (the one field guaranteed unique per real on-disk project) before
//! mapping into the wire type, which never carries `path` — see
//! [`dedupe_by_canonical_path`].
