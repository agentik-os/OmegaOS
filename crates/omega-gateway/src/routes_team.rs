//! `POST /v1/team` — wraps `omega team [OPTIONS] <PROJECT> [MEMBERS]...`
//! (`crates/omega-cli/src/main.rs::cmd_team`, ~line 7520).
//!
//! ## Ground truth (verified against the live `omega team --help` and
//! `cmd_team` itself, not guessed — see `.superpowers/sdd/progress.md`'s
//! Task A section)
//!
//! - `cmd_team` builds the REAL spawned session name literally as
//!   `format!("Team-{project}")` (~line 7531) — so `project` is validated
//!   here with the SAME strict slug charset
//!   [`crate::routes_sessions::valid_new_session_name`] already enforces for
//!   a brand-new session name, reused verbatim rather than duplicated: this
//!   `project` is about to become a session-name COMPONENT, exactly the
//!   reason that check exists.
//! - There is NO `--layout` flag anywhere in the real CLI (`omega team
//!   --help` lists only `-c/--count` and `-d/--dir`) — this endpoint does
//!   not accept a `layout` field at all. A wave brief's higher-level mention
//!   of one was ground-truth-checked against the CLI's own `--help` and
//!   found not to exist, so it is dropped as a documented gap rather than
//!   silently invented.
//! - `count` bounded `1..=8` here is DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH for an API caller —
//!   the real CLI's own default is 3 with no hard cap of its own.
//! - `members` are optional `"name:prompt"` strings passed positionally;
//!   `cmd_team` parses each permissively via `splitn(2, ':')` with no
//!   charset validation of its own, so this endpoint only NUL-checks and
//!   length-caps them, never re-derives a stricter shape the real CLI
//!   doesn't enforce either.
//!
//! `output` is the raw stdout on success — this endpoint deliberately does
//! NOT hand-parse the CLI's own per-member text, mirroring wave7's
//! `reap`/`resurrect` "honest raw output" precedent
//! ([`crate::protocol::ReapResponse`]/[`crate::protocol::ResurrectResponse`]).
